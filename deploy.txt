To host your Varma Investments website on GoDaddy, you have a few options depending on your hosting plan:

Option 1: GoDaddy VPS or Dedicated Server (Recommended for Node.js)
If you have a VPS or Dedicated Server, follow these steps:

1. Build the Production Version
On your local computer, in the project folder:

npm install
npm run build
2. Upload Files to GoDaddy
Using FTP/SFTP (FileZilla, WinSCP, or cPanel File Manager):

Upload the entire project folder to your server (e.g., /home/username/varma-investments/)
3. Connect to Your Server via SSH
Use PuTTY (Windows) or terminal (Linux) to connect:

ssh username@your-server-ip
4. Install Node.js on the Server
# Check if Node.js is installed
node --version
# If not, install it (Ubuntu/Debian):
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
5. Navigate to Your Project and Install Dependencies
cd ~/varma-investments
npm install --production
6. Start the Application
# Set the port (GoDaddy may require specific ports)
export PORT=5000
npm start
7. Keep it Running with PM2
# Install PM2 (process manager)
sudo npm install -g pm2
# Start your app
pm2 start npm --name "varma-investments" -- start
# Make it auto-start on reboot
pm2 startup
pm2 save
8. Point Your Domain
In GoDaddy's domain settings, point your domain to your server's IP address.
